This is a front end demo of what a food delivery website would look like. There is a navigation bar that directs you to whatever you click on, an interactable menu to add items to your cart,
a cart button to redirect you to the cart page where it will show you the options you have added to your cart as well as the option to remove items from your cart,
and the ability to check out the items you selected.
